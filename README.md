## Dataset  

- The dataset is sourced from **[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)**.  
- Contains information about crops and corresponding environmental conditions.  
- Key Features:  
  - `Temperature`  
  - `Humidity`  
  - `Rainfall`  
  - `Soil pH`  

---

## Model and Approach  

- **Data Preprocessing:**  
  - Handled missing values and normalized the dataset.  

- **Feature Selection:**  
  - Selected relevant features for accurate crop prediction.  

- **Machine Learning Model:**  
  - Used a **Random Forest Classifier** for its accuracy and robustness.  
  - Achieved **90%+ accuracy** on the test dataset.  

- **Deployment:**  
  - Integrated the trained model into a Flask web application.  

---

## Future Enhancements  

- Incorporate **soil type** and **market trends** for better recommendations.  
- Deploy the project on cloud platforms like **AWS** or **Heroku**.  
- Add **multi-language support** for global accessibility.
