Overview
This project is a Machine Learning-based solution designed to assist farmers in identifying the most suitable crop to grow based on various factors like soil condition, temperature, humidity, rainfall, and pH levels. It aims to promote sustainable agriculture by improving the accuracy of crop selection and reducing risks associated with crop failure.

Features
üå± Suggests the best crop based on given environmental conditions.
üìä Provides insights into the dataset used for training.
üöÄ Easy-to-use web interface for users (built using Flask).
üõ†Ô∏è Scalable and customizable for other use cases in agriculture.
Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python üêç
Framework: Flask
